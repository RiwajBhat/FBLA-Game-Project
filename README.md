Project Overview
This project was developed for the FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America) 2024-2025 competition in the Computer Games and Simulation Programming category. "The Average Joe's Fantastical Adventure" is a game created to showcase our skills in game development, visual programming, and creative design.
Program Documentation

Game Engine: Scratch 3.0, developed and maintained by MIT Media Lab.
Programming Language: High-level visual programming language using blocks to represent code concepts, based on JavaScript.
Graphic Design Tool: Scratch stage editor and Adobe Photoshop for game graphics.
Audio Tool: Audacity (open-source digital audio editor) and Scratch's built-in audio editor.
Project Packager: TurboWarp, a fork of Scratch 3.0 available on GitHub, used to package SB3 files into HTML files. These are opened using Chromium, creating the illusion of a native launcher for Windows, Linux, and macOS, while running as a Chrome-opened HTML file.
